# Integrated-Fund-Analysis
Integrated Fund Analysis is a Python-based tool that helps investors evaluate investment funds through data downloads, factor regressions, performance analysis, and charting. It is designed for evidence-based investing research and produces both graphical outputs and neatly formatted summaries.
